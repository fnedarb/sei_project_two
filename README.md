# wayfarer - travel site and event finder

### context:<br />
this is a weeklong group project intended to showcase:
* the creation of a django application with a postgresSQL database
* full implementation of ground-up responsive web design
* successful planning of model relationships in an ERD diagram
* use of bootstrap5 for styling
* full user authentication with permissions
* full CRUD for Posts attached to Cities
* admin-side creation of Events that users can research and attend
* successful project execution in a group using github and jira


### concept: <br />
the group was given a list of client requirements to execute. these included:
* a travel site called Wayfarer that displayed cities of interest and posts attached to cities from authentiicated users
* sign in/up process
* full CRUD functionality on posts a user has made with authorization limited to the user's own posts
* ability for users to edit profile information<br />
we also added:
* a home page displaying top cities and events
* index pages for all cities and all events on the site
* search functionality by country, state, and city
<br />
in addition, we added the concept of "Events" going on in each city that our site's users can learn about. they can say they are attending and see a guest list. Events are admin generated.



### process: <br />
* our process began by discussing the overall concept and requirements, followed by basic wireframing and user story creation in figma and the drafting of an ERD to plan our models and relationships <br />

* we divided work by creating a backlog of stories in jira. we then started a mini-sprint to execute our assigned tickets <br />
